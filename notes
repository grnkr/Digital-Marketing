Marketing Funnel & Customer Journey
ChatGPT said:
Here's a clear and structured breakdown of Marketing Funnel & Customer Journey — ideal for notes, workshops, or presentations:

🔄 Marketing Funnel & Customer Journey
🎯 What is a Marketing Funnel?
A Marketing Funnel is a model that illustrates the stages a customer goes through before making a purchase.

Visualize it like a funnel: many people enter at the top, but only a few convert into customers at the bottom.

📍 Main Stages of the Marketing Funnel

Stage	Customer Mindset	Your Goal
1. Awareness	"I just found out about this."	Grab attention through ads, SEO, blogs
2. Interest	"This looks interesting."	Educate with content, emails, videos
3. Desire	"I think I need this."	Build desire through reviews, testimonials, comparison
4. Action	"I’ll buy it!"	Make it easy to purchase — clear CTAs, discounts, limited offers
5. Loyalty (optional stage)	"I love this brand."	Retain through rewards, support, and updates
💡 The AIDA Model (Popular Funnel Concept)

AIDA Stage	Explanation	Example
A – Attention	Capture interest	Social Media Ads, Viral Content
I – Interest	Keep them engaged	Blog posts, Product Demos
D – Desire	Show value & benefits	Testimonials, Reviews, Offers
A – Action	Convert to customer	Buy Now button, Checkout Page
🧭 What is a Customer Journey?

2. Consideration	Comparing options and researching solutions
3. Purchase	Making the decision to buy
4. Retention	Staying engaged and loyal

HubSpot or Salesforce CRM

Journey Mapping Tools like Miro, Lucidchart
